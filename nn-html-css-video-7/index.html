            <h2>Musical Instruments</h2>
            <p> A musical instrument is a device created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object
                that
                produces sound can be considered a musical instrumentâ€”it is through purpose that the object becomes a
                musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early
                musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a horn to signal success on the hunt, or a
                drum
                in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for
                entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications and technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object
                that
                some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple flute, dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some
                consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that
                determining a
                specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible, as many early musical instruments were made
                from animal skins, bone, wood and other non-durable materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact
                among
                civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By
                the
                Middle Ages, instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia, and Europeans played
                instruments
                originating from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of
                North,
                Central, and South America shared musical instruments.
